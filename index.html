	<td><p>Hi! I am Brooks Pinson. I am Senior Agribusiness major here at The University of Georgia.</p>
	<p> Along with being a student here, I am a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho Fraternity, commonly known as AGR.</p>
	<p> During the week, I am either going to school, or going to work at my job in the Horticulture department of UGA, where I tend to a branch of greenhouses. </p>
	<p> If I'm not doing either of those, I am most likely hanging out with my friends, my dog, or playing video games.</p>
	<p> During the fall semester, my absolute favorite thing to do is spend my Saturdays cheering for the Dawgs. </p>
